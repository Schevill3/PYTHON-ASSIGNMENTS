## 📌 Assignment Overview
This project contains solutions for **Assignment 1** and **Activity 2**.
The work demonstrates the use of **classes, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism** in Python.

---

## 🏗️ Assignment 1: Superhero Class with Inheritance
- A base class **`Superhero`** is created with attributes like `name`, `power`, and `strength`.
- Two subclasses are added:
  - **`FlyingHero`** → Adds flying ability with `flight_speed`.
  - **`StrongHero`** → Adds super strength with `lifting_power`.
- Each class has methods to perform actions such as **training, flying, or lifting objects**.

---

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- A base class **`Vehicle`** is defined with a `move()` method.
- Three subclasses override the `move()` method differently:
  - **`Car`** → "Driving on the road 🚗"
  - **`Plane`** → "Flying in the sky ✈️"
  - **`Boat`** → "Sailing on the water 🚤"
- A list of vehicles demonstrates **polymorphism** by calling the same method with different results.

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Download the file: `assignment1_activity2.py`
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
python assignment1_activity2.py
```

4. You will see output showing:
   - The superheroes’ details and actions.
   - Different vehicle movements.
